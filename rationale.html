			<h2>Dashboard</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of a regular webpage, we created a dashboard web-app. You can smoothly click through sections while following along with the teacher or easily refer back to something after class. We made it responsive so that you can access it most devices by using jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The teacherâ€™s dashboard can also be viewed on a projector using the alternate stylesheet. 
			</p>

			<h2>Personalized</h2>

			<p>	
				We made the dashboard very personalized to each student. As soon as they arrive at their dashboard they get the latest up to date announcements, quick visual links to which lessons they have to do and which have been completed, and their grade which would be added once the data is integrated. This will ensure the student is fully immersed and keeps them connected. 
			</p>
				
			<h2>Fun Learning</h2>
			<p>
				We gamified the learning experience, so when the user has complete a lecture they win a tick mark and the card in the dashboard changes colours. Each lesson is easy to follow along with expanding links on the navigation so you can jump to the exact location you want or sort to find exactly what you are looking for. We used bright pastel colours to make it more exciting!
