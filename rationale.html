			<h2>Dashboard</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of a regular webpage, we created a dashboard web-app. You can smoothly click through sections while 
				following along with the teacher or easily refer back to something after class. We made it responsive so that 
				you can access it most devices by using jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Targeting modern web standards allowed us to to
				use properties like display:flex to scale content for different display sizes. The teacherâ€™s dashboard can also be viewed on 
				a projector using the alternate stylesheet. 
			</p>

			<h2>Personalized</h2>

			<p>	
				We made the dashboard very personalized to each student. As soon as they arrive at their dashboard they get the latest up to date announcements,
				quick visual links to which lessons they have to do and which have been completed, and their grade which would be added once the data is integrated.
				This will ensure the student is fully immersed and keeps them connected. 
			</p>
				
			<h2>Fun Learning</h2>
			<p>
				We gamified the learning experience, so when the user has complete a lecture they win a tick mark and the card in the
				dashboard changes colours. Each lesson is easy to follow along with expanding links on the navigation so you can jump
				to the exact location you want or sort to find exactly what you are looking for. We used bright pastel colours to make
				it more exciting!
			</p>
			<h2>Search Engine Ready</h2>
			<p>
				Structuring our site to have easily understandable urls (ex. protosite/week/3/lesson.html) makes it easy for people or search engines to explore the site.
			</p>
			<h2>Quiz</h2>
			<p>
				The quiz was designed to provide quiz content with a minimum of distraction to the student. It presents the time the quiz needs to be submitted and the questions. 
				By using html5's "required" property on the student number box, it provides a nice reminder to the student if it has been forgotten. We've also used a print style to 
				allow the quiz page to function as a printed quiz page should the need arise.
